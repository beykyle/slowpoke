# slowpoke
A python tool for demonstrating how ultrafine-group neutron slowing down calculations are used to generate multigroup cross section libraries 
for use in whole-core reactor simulations.

This is intended soley for educational purposes.

See the [theory document](/th/numerical-slowing-down.pdf) for an explanation of the numerical method
