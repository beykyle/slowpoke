# slowpoke
A python tool for demonstrating how ultrafine-group neutron slowing down calculations are used to generate multigroup cross section libraries 
for use in whole-core reactor simulations

Note: the name of the codebase works two ways: it is a numerical slowing down code, that runs slowly. This is intended for demonstration purposes only.

See the [theory document](/th/numerical-slowing-down.pdf) for an explanation of the numerical method
